# CREATING EC2 AND RDS
## Overview
#### Lab Duration: 1 Hour


Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks. With RDS, you can use the database products you are already familiar with like Db2, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL. Amazon RDS manages backups, software patching, automatic failure detection, and recovery.

In addition to the security in your database package, you can help control who can access your RDS databases. To do so, you can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to define users and permissions. You can also help protect your databases by putting them in a virtual private cloud (VPC).
